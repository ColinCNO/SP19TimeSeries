## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


##Importing Data
dat <- read.csv("income.csv", header = TRUE)

##Time Series
# Convert data_vector to a ts object with start = 2004 and frequency = 4
time_series <- ts(data_vector, start = 2004, frequency = 4)
print(time_series)
plot(time_series)

# Check if Time Series
is.ts(Nile)

# US TS Plot and add a legend
ts.plot(EuStockMarkets, col = 1:4, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Index Value", main = "Major European Stock Indices, 1991-1998")
legend("topleft", colnames(EuStockMarkets), lty = 1, col = 1:4, bty = "n")
